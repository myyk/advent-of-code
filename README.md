# Advent of Code

This project contains some solutions for https://adventofcode.com/. I kind of try to keep the old ones running, but it's not easy with language migrations.

# Downloading Inputs

You can run the `download-input.sh` script to download the input into the resource directory to make that a little easier. You need to copy the session from the cookie in your browser.

It can be run like this to download year `2022` day `1` input:

    ADVENT_SESSION=XXXXXXXXXXX ./scripts/download-input.sh 2022 1


# 2018

First year attempted.

# 2020

Second year attempted.

# 2021

For the first many problems, I tried to get VS Code to solve all the questions.

Used `nix` in the setup.

# 2022

Migrated to DevContainers for easier setup.
